## üóª Challenge

### Challenge Description

You will need to recreate the three pages mentioned above while staying true to your original design.

Delivery date: 09/03/2024 ‚Äì 5:30 pm ‚Äì Tuesday.

Each presentation will last a maximum of 10 minutes.

### The **MANDATORY** requirements are:

- Use front-end in React with TypeScript.
- Back-end in Node (TypeScript required).
- Use of any is prohibited.
- Database using mongoDB or sql lite.
- It is necessary to protect the Tours route.
- Create sliders to display the most popular tours and types of activities in the sessions, in Carousel format. Library recommendation: [Splide](https://splidejs.com/), [Splide for React docs.](https://splidejs.com/integration/react-splide/) (Feel free to use the library of your choice).
- Use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?hl=pt-br), to handle user authentication. Authentication must be possible with: email, Facebook and Google.
- All features must be using the API developed in Node, data persistence should not be done in the Front. - You can use an external library for styling.
- You must choose the images.
- Create a private repository on your Github and add the instructors as collaborators to the project.
- Add a README to your project.
- Make small commits and use Conventional Commits to keep your repository organized.
- All images must be hosted in an S3 bucket (general purpose) or Firebase Storage.

#### Header:
- Login/Sign up page with the design created by you;
- Search button searching for all existing tours.
#### Footer:
- Each social network link must redirect to the home page of each network.
- Email field must be validated.
#### Home:
- Develop the search field.
- The Type field is an ‚ÄòExperience‚Äô field, such as beaches.
- Tours Session must contain the most popular tours session chosen by you, and the data must come from the back-end, and must be in carousel format, the number of tours must be 8 (eight).
- Hover on the favorite button.
- Session to choose a ‚ÄòType‚Äô must come with the API data, the logic will be: search in the back-end how many tours there are with x category and render this value and the minimum value among those tours. For example: in the API there are 15 Tours with the Beaches category, and the minimum value is from $650, so it should render ‚Äò15 Tours+‚Äô and ‚ÄòFrom $650‚Äô. Render all categories that are in the back-end.
- Contact Us has no functionality.
- Top Attractions Cards must bring data from the back-end, displaying at least 6 cards. If you choose to make the pages optional, the click must redirect to the destination details page.
#### Destination - OPCIONAL:
- Top Attractions cards must bring data from the back-end, displaying at least 12 cards. We recommend doing this with Grid. When clicking on a card, it will direct you to the details page of that destination.
#### Destination Details - OPCIONAL:
- Fixed images, ‚ÄòSee more photos‚Äô button does not need to be functional.
- Use Google Maps API to bring the location of the destination.
- Use Weather API to bring information from the local weather table.
- Destination information all coming from the back-end.
- Carousel with popular tours in that destination, when clicking on ‚ÄòSee All‚Äô it should direct to the tours page with the filter for that place selected.
- ‚ÄòActivities‚Äô carousel should be disregarded.
#### Tour Package:
- ALL FUNCTIONAL FILTERS.
- Filter data such as categories/destinations must come from the back-end.
- Must contain pagination directly from the back-end.
- Keep reviews with fixed value, they do not need to be broken values.
#### Tour Details:
- Fixed image of that destination.
- All tour information coming from the back-end.
- Sessions to be disregarded: Included/Exclude, Tour Places, Calendar & Price.
- Calculate as the user adds more people in the filter on the right-hand side menu.
- Use Google Maps API to bring the tour location.
#### Reviews:
- Average Reviews is an average of the reviews, so the highest rating should be an average of the other six ratings on the right.
- Values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be integers.
- In the field to add a review, the user should rate each service by entering how many stars it deserves.
- The user should be able to enter the name and email of their choice. it is not necessary to retrieve it from the Login.
- The comment should be rendered on the page when submitted and the average reviews should change.

### The **OPTIONAL** requirements are:
- Responsive application.
- Landing page and destination details.
