  title: API RESTful - Trisog
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    This project involves the development of a **RESTful API using Node.js and
    TypeScript**, with a focus on integrating **MongoDB** for database
    management. The API is designed to manage **touristic experiences**,
    allowing users to interact with data related to destinations, activities,
    bookings, and reviews.


    The API will enable users to perform essential operations such as creating,
    retrieving, updating, and deleting information about destinations and
    activities. Additionally, it will support booking management and user
    reviews for these experiences. Security and data privacy are key priorities,
    with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented using
    **Firebase Authentication**.


    **Firebase Storage** is utilized for managing and storing user-uploaded
    images associated with experiences. **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are
    employed to ensure consistent and scalable deployment across different
    environments. **Jest** is used for unit and integration testing, ensuring
    the reliability and quality of the API.


    **Prisma** is used as the ORM tool to facilitate interaction with MongoDB,
    providing a robust and type-safe interface for database queries and data
    manipulation. This allows for efficient and secure data handling throughout
    the application.


    For API documentation, **Swagger UI** is integrated with the
    **'swagger-ui-express'** package in conjunction with **'swagger-jsdoc'** to
    automatically generate and maintain up-to-date documentation from source
    code annotations. This facilitates a clear understanding and ease of use for
    developers and users interacting with the API.


    Dependencies are managed with **Yarn**, providing a reliable and efficient
    way to handle project libraries. The project is deployed on **Vercel**,
    which ensures high performance and scalability for the API.


    In summary, this software aims to deliver a **comprehensive and secure API
    for managing touristic experiences**, ensuring a seamless user experience
    and effective management of data related to destinations and activities.
